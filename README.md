## flutter_alarm_app
**A flutter project to demonstrate my problem-solving skills**

## Demo
[üåê View Live Web App](https://hasan-uddin.github.io/flutter_alarm_app/)
- note:
  1. Onboarding screen loads only once. Delete cookies to initialise again.
  2. The app was made heavily focused and tested on Android, so some functionality might not work for the web

## Objectives
- To implement Onboarding screens (once-first-time)
- To implement the Location permission prompt
- To implement Alarm/Notification setting functionality
- To store the alarms in a local database 
- To build a Flutter mobile platform.
- To manage state and UI in Flutter with widgets.
- To integrate 3rd party libraries.
- To work with the Dart language and Flutter‚Äôs widget tree structure.
- To use GitHub Actions to automate building and deploying Flutter web apps to GitHub Pages.
